Hi Gophers! Unfortunately, I don't have the time to maintain this library right now, so I can't add any features. I'll gladly accept pull requests if you're interested. Also, if you'd like to maintaining the library longer term, I'm also happy to welcome you as a contributor. If you're interested in either submitting a PR or being a longer term maintainer, please let me know on the [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/). My username there is `arschles`.

# functional-go

Applying functional programming (FP) concepts to Go!

This repository is an experiment in how far we can push Go to implement
Functional Programming design patterns. Note that the types herein are hard-coded
for specific types, but you could use code generation to produce these FP constructs
for any type you please!

If you're interested, please contribute any way you wish. Here are some 
ideas:

- Submit an [issue](https://github.com/go-functional/core/issues) with a 
question, comment, or anything else
- Make a change and submit a 
[pull request](https://github.com/go-functional/core/pulls). Even if 
you aren't a "FP person" or don't know what you're doing, I want to 
hear what you think, and sometimes the best way to do that is through 
code :)
